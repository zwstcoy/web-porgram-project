			<h1>Family Friendly</h1>
			<p>Easily accessible from several points of entry/parking in town.
			 Not strenuous or technical, and there are plenty of facilities for food, 
			 restrooms, water, etc. along the way if kids get tired/hungry.</p>
			 
			 <h1>Overview </h1>
			 <p>This route highlights the best of Atlanta's parks, markets, and restaurants from one of the most popular sections of the Atlanta Beltline.
			  Enjoy a balance of skyline views and green spaces along with an assortment of art displays right along the path! There are numerous ways one can 
			  approach and customize this urban hike. You can park and enter the route from a few different paces (or bike to it depending on where
			   you are coming from), you can make your route through Piedmont Park longer or shorter (or skip it) to change the length of the hike, 
			   and take various side trips to places along the way. This featured route is a great template from which to start exploring this area.</p>
			   
			  <h1>Description </h1>
			  <p>Park in the gravel lot behind Park Tavern and start at the back of the parking lot to follow the dirt trail through a lightly wooded area. 
			  You'll soon pass under the Park Drive Bridge (see "History/Background"). After passing the backside of Piedmont Park Dog Park (to the left) 
			  and crossing a service road, continue for another couple of minutes to a short section under tree cover with steep, rocky embankments on either side 
			  (looking to the right among the rocks for a hidden art gem). Cross the wooden footbridge over Clear Creek and take a left before you cross the
			   service road (you'll see a blue gate on the other side and the continuation of the Beltline, but we are diverting here back into Piedmont Park).</p>
