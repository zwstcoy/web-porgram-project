			<h1>Family Friendly</h1>
			<p>With many starting and stopping points, plus stops for food and drink along the way, this route is perfect for the whole family.</p>
			 
			<h1>Overview </h1>
			<p>This out-and back journey begins at the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site in downtown Atlanta. From there, 
			the paved trail heads east/northeast through a series of greenspaces and parks (including Freedom Park) and continues, 
			eventually, all the way to Stone Mountain Park. (On different maps, you may see it labeled first as Freedom Trail and then 
			change to Stone Mountain Trail as it goes east, depending on the map/source. Some may have the whole thing labeled as Stone Mt. 
			Trail, and visa/versa.) </p>
			   
			<h1>Description </h1>
			<p>One option is to begin from the King Center and Historic Ebenezer Baptist Church.
			 Cross Auburn Avenue heading north through the grounds of The MLK National Historic Site and the 
			 (new) Ebenezer Baptist Church. If you keep the historic site building on your left, you can follow sidewalks up through the 
			 middle of the block to then cross Irwin Street. After one more block, cross Cain Street and keep right on the path when you have a choice, 
			 heading east, (it will bend sharply left first). You'll be parallel with the south side of Freedom Parkway. Right after crossing Highland Ave, 
			 you'll come across your first opportunity for food in the Old 4th Ward area (unless you want to wait until the end point of this out-and-back trip).
			  To the right, you'll see a place called "Across the Street". If you divert here, there are several choices, including Highland Bakery: a popular 
			  breakfast/brunch/lunch spot. </p>
